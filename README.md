# Rockbuster
This project was created as part of a Data Analytics Immersion course. On it I dive into the available data to answer key business questions.

## Rockbuster Stealth Analysis
**Introduction**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world.
Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

In this project, I take the role of a data analyst hired by Rockbuster Stealth LLC to find answers before their online video launch. To do so I created different queries from different departments to be able to answer key questions the business has.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project contains information on the inventory, customers and transactions of Rockbuster in a PostrgreSQL database format.

**Key Questions to answer**
Which movies are pivotal for revenue?
Average rental duration for videos?
